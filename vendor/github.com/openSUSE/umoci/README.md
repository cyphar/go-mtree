**Status: Beta**

**u**moci **m**odifies **O**pen **C**ontainer **i**mages. Not a great name, but
what are you going to do. It also is a cool way for people to "dip their toe"
into OCI images ("umoci" also means "to dip" in Serbian).

`umoci` intends to be a complete manipulation tool for [OCI images][oci-image-spec].
In particular, it should be seen as a more end-user-focused version of the
[`oci-image-tools` provided by the OCI][oci-image-tools]. The hope is that all
of this tooling will eventually be merged with the upstream repository, so that
it is always kept up-to-date by the Open Container Initiative community.

However, currently there is a [lot][disc-1] [of][disc-2] [discussion][disc-3]
about the new tooling going into the OCI image tools, and right now I need
tooling that can abstract all of the internals of the OCI specification into a
single CLI interface. The main purpose of this tool is to serve as example of
what **I** would like to see in an `oci-image` tool.

If you wish to provide feedback or contribute, read the
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`][contributing] for this project to refresh your knowledge

### In Progress ###

Currently `umoci` relies on several from-scratch implementations of existing
PRs against upstream projects (or aliased vendor projects that include PRs
merged that are not merged upstream). This is because currently upstream
projects are simply not mature enough to be used. However, this is something
that I'm working on fixing.
